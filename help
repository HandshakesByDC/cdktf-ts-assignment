 Use Providers:

  You can add prebuilt providers (if available) or locally generated ones using the add command:
  
  pnpx cdktf provider add "aws@~>3.0" null kreuzwerker/docker

  You can find all prebuilt providers on npm: https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:cdktf
  You can also install these providers directly through npm:

  pnpm install @cdktn/provider-aws
  pnpm install @cdktn/provider-docker
  pnpm install @cdktn/provider-github
  pnpm install @cdktn/provider-null

  You can also build any module or provider locally. Learn more https://cdk.tf/modules-and-providers
